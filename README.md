Overview: This assignment includes several small C programs designed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, input validation, and control structures (like if-else and switch). The tasks help reinforce understanding of program flow, logical operators, and user interaction in C.
Programs Included:

1. Admission Eligibility Checker:
                                 The Admission Eligibility Checker is a C program designed to assess a student's eligibility for college admission based on specific criteria. This assignment introduces you to decision-making structures in C, such as if-else statements, nested conditionals, and logical operators, which are essential for evaluating multiple criteria within a program.
The program simulates a real-world scenario in which eligibility conditions must be met for a student to gain admission, making it a practical exercise in applying conditional logic.

2.Electricity Bill Calculator:
                        The Electricity Bill Calculator is a C program designed to calculate a user's electricity bill based on their power consumption and a specified tariff rate structure. This assignment demonstrates the use of conditional statements to apply different rates depending on usage slabs, making it an ideal project for learning how to structure and calculate rates based on real-world criteria.

3.Blood Donation Eligibility:
                             The Blood Donation Eligibility Checker is a C program designed to determine whether an individual is eligible to donate blood based on specific health and demographic criteria. This assignment gives you practical experience with conditionals and logical operators, as well as input validation, by simulating an application that assesses eligibility for blood donation.

4.Income Tax Calculator:
                       The Income Tax Calculator is a C program designed to compute the tax owed by an individual based on their annual income and specific tax slabs. This assignment provides hands-on practice with conditional statements, arithmetic calculations, and input validation, simulating a real-world application of calculating taxes.

5.Bank ATM Withdrawal Eligibility:
                                  The Bank ATM Withdrawal Eligibility Checker is a C program designed to assess whether a customer can withdraw a specified amount from their bank account using an ATM. The program checks the customer's account balance against the requested withdrawal amount, applies any withdrawal limits, and considers any special permissions needed for large withdrawals. This assignment helps you learn decision-making, condition handling, and user input validation in C.

6.Student Grade with Pass/Fail Status:
                                      The Student Grade and Pass/Fail Status program is a C application designed to calculate a student's grade based on their score and determine if they have passed or failed. This assignment demonstrates how to use conditionals to evaluate numerical ranges, apply grading criteria, and provide feedback based on specific score thresholds. Itâ€™s a useful exercise in applying decision-making logic with if-else statements.

7.Online Shopping Discount System:
                                   The Online Shopping Discount System is a C program designed to calculate the final price of a customer's purchase after applying discounts based on the purchase amount and membership status. This assignment introduces students to conditional statements and logical operators, allowing them to implement a basic discount logic that mirrors real-world online shopping scenarios.

8.Health Insurance Eligibility:
                               The Health Insurance Eligibility Checker is a C program designed to determine whether an individual qualifies for health insurance coverage based on specific criteria such as age, employment status, and pre-existing conditions. This assignment helps students practice their skills in using conditional statements, logical operators, and input validation in a practical context.

9.Day of the Week Determiner:
                              The Day of the Week Determiner is a C program designed to take a user input representing a number (1-7) and output the corresponding day of the week. This assignment provides practice in using conditional statements and input validation, offering students a practical application of programming concepts to enhance user interaction and program functionality.

10.Loan Approval System:
                         The Loan Approval System is a C program designed to evaluate whether an individual qualifies for a loan based on specific criteria, such as income, credit score, and loan amount requested. This assignment introduces students to decision-making processes using conditional statements, user input handling, and logical operators to simulate a real-world loan approval scenario.
